# zeus-erp-project

Please note this is a unfinished project, shutted down while yet in initial stage. It's dependencies are obsolete and the code may be a mess because I didn't have many experience in that time.

This project was created to become a management system of a ISP (Internet Service Provider), where I got my first job.

It should support:

- Registered billets to Bradesco Bank (CNAB400)
- Fiberhome integration with ONU authorization, configuration and monitoring
- Tech support for customers
- And another stuffs

The project is not finished because the ISP was bought by another one and this project was shut down.

The server package has a dependency developed by me that is not available for public. It's a private lib of mine (I have a open version [here](https://github.com/felipebergamin/node-tl1-fiberhome))

## Packages
